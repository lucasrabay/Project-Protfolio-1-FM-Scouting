## Introduction

The Football Manager (FM) Database Scouting Project is an SQL-based endeavor that allows users to practice, develop, and showcase their database querying skills. Inspired by the popular Football Manager game, this project simulates real-life scouting and recruitment processes for a lower league English football club that has recently been promoted. It aims to assist club scouts in identifying potential signings for the upcoming season.

## Features

- **Player Scouting**: Query and search for potential transfers based on various criteria such as player attributes, positions, age, and contract status.

- **Scouting Reports**: Generate detailed scouting reports for each player, providing essential information to aid the club's decision-making process. These reports may include player performance statistics, market value, and potential transfer costs.

- **Filtering and Sorting**: Filter and sort players based on specific attributes or performance metrics, enabling scouts to focus on specific targets.
